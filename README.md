# Katie Bobbe's Secure Password Generator

## Description

This portfolio was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The main goal of building this application was to use JavaScript to generate a randomized secure password based on user selected criteria.

The first iteration of this project involved collecting user input through prompts. I improved the user experience of this application by removing the need for alerts and prompts. Instead, users can select password length and desired character sets through a form.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the project in a text editor of your choice
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view

## Usage 

A user fills out a short form that requires password length (8-128 characters), and the selection of at least one character set. Users can choose to include special characters, numbers, lowercase letters and uppercase letters. After the user specifies the password length and character selection, the user will click the "generate password" button. This will show a password in the text area below. The user can click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the password to their clipboard, or they can click the "Generate Password" button again to make a new password.

If the user does not specify a valid password length or does not select a character set, they will receive an error message in the text box below the "Generate Password" button.
